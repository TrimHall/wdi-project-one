# Approach

## Planning:

I planned that MVP would be a single column with collision detection for the notes and ability to score points if the user pressed the correct key at the right time. The next step was psudocoding the processes involved that I didn't already know how to do, such as figuring out how to 'fire' a note in time with the music, detect a collision etc.

I then planned out what function I would need and started to build a very basic version of the game.
